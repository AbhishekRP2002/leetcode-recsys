- can we build a leetcode problems recommendation system using the user stats and his/her recent submissions ?

  1. write a script to collect the User data from Leetcode GraphQL API
  2. Create a dataset of Leetcode problems and it's attributes --> Figure the best dataset considering the data quality such that it can determine the recommendations most accurately
  3. How can we leverage the source of truth ( gathered dataset ) to map to user's recent problems ? --> This requires some thought and coding maybe ? Think about it more
  4. 3 will be part of the recommendation system  core logic ?
  5. how can I use an LLM or LLM Function Calling here ? is it worthy giving a thought in this direction ? dont heavily depend on prompt engineering
- try to modular code with clear separation of concerns
